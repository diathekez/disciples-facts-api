# Disciples Facts API
This API pulls up some basic facts about the Twelve Disciples, such as how they died, how many books they wrote, and whether they were one of the Three or not.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Heroku, & Postman

I built this with vanilla JS using VSCode and the built-in Git Bash terminal. I used Postman to test it before pushing it to Github and deploying it on Heroku.

## Optimizations

In the future, I'll expand the API and rename it to include every single biblical character of note, as well as the verse where he/she is first mentioned and the last.

## Conclusions

Although this is so basic, coding this gave me an incredible amount of confidence in myself. At the time of this writing, I was programming my church's website. They recently received funding to continue projects that they had to put on pause because of the pandemic. One of those projects is to provide nutrition and care to children from Manchay, a poverty-stricken zone of Lima, Peru. Just successfully doing what is a standard rite of passage for programmers encouraged me to keep going and learn so I can better serve those who are in need.
